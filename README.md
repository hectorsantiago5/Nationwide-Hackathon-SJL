**Focus**

The Social Justice League is a group of four WSSU students who have chosen
to focus on Social Justice, as it pertains to Covid vaccination in North Carolina. The goal is to 
gather and visualize data to draw correlations between COVID-19 vaccine locations and underrepresented counties.

**Plan**

The Social Justice league plans to create a website and a Jupyter notebook that will accuratly and effeciently give access to data
dealing with this area. The data will consist 

**1.** Vaccination Sites

**2.** County-level vaccinations numbers (Fully & Partially)

**3.** Vaccinations based on Demographics

**4.** Short videos that describe general vaccination process and challenges faced 

**How can you gain access?**

A link will be provided.
